# Movement Data Analysis

This work will present the analysis for an anonymous subject about his/her daily
movement activities.

## Preparing the data

First, we need to unzip the dataset -if wasn't made previously-

```{r}
if(!file.exists("activity.csv")){
        unzip(zipfile = "activity.zip")
}
```
